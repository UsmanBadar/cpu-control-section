# Simplified CPU Control Circuit - Based on *How Do It Know?*

This repository contains a Logisim implementation of the CPU control section from the book *How Do It Know?* by J. Clark Scott. The design has been enhanced for better organisation and replicability using tunnels in Logisim. Additionally, a few enhancements were inspired by the concepts learned in the Udemy course [Design a CPU](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-a-cpu).

## Features
- **Simplified and organised CPU control section**: The circuit uses tunnels in Logisim to reduce clutter and make the design more comprehensible.
- **Based on foundational learning**: Concepts from *How Do It Know?* and the Udemy course were integrated to create an effective and educational design.
- **Extensible project**: Currently focused on the CPU control section, with plans to expand into other CPU components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Logisim](https://www.cburch.com/logisim/) installed on your computer.

### Running the Circuit

- Open Logisim and load the `.circ` file after downloading it from this repository.
- Use Logisim's simulation tools to analyze the circuit's behavior.

### Background

This project stems from my exploration of CPU design concepts detailed in the book *How Do It Know?* by J. Clark Scott. The book provides a beginner-friendly approach to understanding how CPUs work.

I also enhanced my design with the help of the Udemy course [Design a CPU](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-a-cpu), which introduced me to efficient techniques and tools for circuit implementation.

### Usage

This project is intended for:

- Learning and understanding CPU control design.
- Exploring circuit design techniques in Logisim.
- Serving as a foundation for building a complete CPU.

### Future Work

- Implementation of other CPU components, such as the ALU and memory sections.
- Integration of additional features to extend functionality.
- Optimisation for more complex control operations.

### Acknowledgments

- *How Do It Know?* by J. Clark Scott for its clear and practical introduction to CPU design.
- [Design a CPU](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-a-cpu) course.
- Logisim for providing a simple yet powerful tool for circuit design and simulation.
